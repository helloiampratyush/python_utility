## vision tools
* image conversion tool :- you can convert any image format to any format :-
1.  applicable (jpeg,jpg,svg,gif,webp,png,bmp,pjp,avif) multiple
2.  input -: image folder where you contains respective  format imges
3.  caution:- your previous folder image will be deleted permanently

## Here are the important points for each image extension 

  1. **JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)**

     * Best for photographs and realistic images.
     * Uses lossy compression, which can reduce quality.

  2. **PNG (Portable Network Graphics)**
     * Ideal for images needing transparency.
     * Uses lossless compression, preserving quality.

  3. **GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)**
     * Supports simple animations.
     * Limited to 256 colors.

  4. **WebP**
     * Balances quality and file size.
     * Supports both lossy and lossless compression.

  5. **AVIF (AV1 Image File Format)**
     * Provides high compression efficiency.
     * Supports HDR (High Dynamic Range).

  6. **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**
     * Best for vector graphics and illustrations.
     * Scalable without losing quality.
